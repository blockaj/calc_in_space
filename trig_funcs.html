				<h1>Trigonometric Functions</h1>
					<p>
						The science boys love to spot satellites through their little telescope, on their roof in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Because of their involvement in the project, they're especially excited to see the Blockey Satellite as it passes over the city. The distance of the satellite from an axis through the Earth that intercepts Kennedy Space Center is given by the equation 
					</p>
					<p class="equation">
						$$
							f(x)=r(sin(\theta))
						$$
					</p> 
					<p>
					where $r$ represents the distance from the core of the Earth to the satellite, and $\theta$ represents the angle from the Kennedy Axis to the core of the Earth to the satellite. The average distance from the center of the Earth to the surface is 6,371 km (Sharp), and the satellite orbits 900 km above the surface. When the satellite is over Philadelphia, is equal to 11.4259. The science boys want to know, at that moment, how fast the satellite is moving away from the axis. 
					</p>
					<p>
						To figure this out, we can use the trig function derivative rules, which states that
					</p>
					<p class="equation">
						$$
						f^\prime(sin(\theta)) = cos\theta
						$$
					</p>
					<p>
						This means that
					</p>
					<p class="equation">
						$$
						\frac{d}{d\theta}(7271(sin\theta)) = 7271cos\theta
						$$
					</p>
					<p>
						Now we can plug in for $\theta$, giving us
					</p>
					<p class="equation">
						$$
						\begin{equation}
						\begin{split}
						\frac{d}{d\theta}|_{\theta=11.4259}&=7271(cos(11.4259)) \\
						&=3033.22
						\end{split}
						\end{equation}
						$$
					</p>
					<p>
						This means that, as it passes over Philadelphia, the satellite is moving away from the axis at a rate of $3033.22 \frac{km}{radian}$.
